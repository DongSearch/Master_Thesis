## 🎯 Goal: 
 we present a frequency-separated parallel SiT block design for REG. The proposed method splits one long SiT block line into low- and high- frequency branches in parallel, allowing low-resolution processing during early diffusion steps and progressively introducing high-resolution refinement as denoising proceeds. 

## 📅 Key milestone  
- **Jan 10**: envrionment configuration, data preprosessing and SiT Block deploitation based on frequencies
